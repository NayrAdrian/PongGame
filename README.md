Pong is a classic video game that simulates table tennis. This was made using Python and Turtle Graphics.

Concept:

Two-dimensional (2D) sports game
Inspired by table tennis

- can be played by two people
- the ball should not reach each players
- deflect the ball by moving the paddle
- control each paddles by clicking 'W' and 'S' key for Left Player and 'Up' and 'Down' key for Right Player

Objective:

Hit the ball back and forth across a virtual table using your paddle
Earn points by making your opponent miss the ball

The ball bounces off the top and bottom edges of the screen, just like a real table tennis ball
As the game progresses, the ball may increase in speed, adding difficulty
